# Train Scheduler
A Firebase application that provides up-to-date information about (fictional) train times and schedules.


The deployed app is found on Firebase [here]( https://jok405.github.io/Train-Scheduler/)!

The page design is constructed in `Bootstrap` and the functionality utilizes `jQuery` and `Moment.js` to append trains in chronological order. All data is persistent using the `Firebase API`.
